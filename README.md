# Frontend-Flex

**Frontend-Flex** is a growing collection of **React mini-projects** built with **Vite**. This repo is my personal space to revise core frontend concepts, one focused project at a time.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This project is in its early stages. Iâ€™ve just started working on it and will be adding new mini-projects regularly as I revise different parts of React.

Stay tuned â€” more projects and concepts are on the way!

## ðŸ“š What's the Goal?

* Reinforce core React concepts like state, props, hooks, and component structure
* Build small, self-contained apps that demonstrate concepts clearly
* Practice clean, modular code
* Evolve the repo as my understanding deepens

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **React**
* **React-Router**
* **TypeScript**
* **TailwindCSS**

## ðŸ”„ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubh-v21/frontend-flex.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the repo:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-flex
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo?

* Itâ€™s my **React playground**
* A place to **experiment, learn, and iterate**
* A useful reference for anyone revisiting **frontend basics**

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans

* Add more mini-projects focused on specific topics (e.g., forms, routing, API calls)
* Improve UI/UX and folder structure
